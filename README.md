# Graphing Calculator
A simple c++ graphing calculator.

### Version 2 (new.cpp)

Now rewritten with better logic and more features.

When you run, the program will prompt you for an equation. It will accept any implicit equation (eg `0=x-y`) using these symbols:
- Groups: `(` ... `)`
- Variables: `x`, `y`, any lowercase letter a-z
- Numbers: `123`, `123.456`, `0.123`, `.123`, `123.0`
- Operators: `+`, `-` (subtract and negate), `*`, `/`, `^` (exponent), `%` (modulo*)
- Multiplication also happens when two values are next to each other, eg `xy`, `3x` or even `3 4`
- Functions: `SIN(x)`, `PI()` - Constants and functions. See FUNCTIONS.md
- Spaces are ignored

\**Modulo is defined using the c++ std::fmod function*

The calculator follows order of operations when solving equations, and
does so in the following order from left to right:
- Negation
- Groups
- Exponentation
- Multiplication
- Division
- Modulo
- Subtraction
- Addition

### Features
- Equation parsing (see above)
- Equation graphing
- Common mathematical functions (see FUNCTIONS.md)
- Save and recall functions for later (lost when program ends, run program and type `:help` for details)
- Easy graph navigation/zoom (run program and type `:help` for details)

### Reading the graph
- `x-` and `y-` axes are drawn on the graph (using `|` and `_`)
  - *Although, the x-axis location is sometimes misleading*
- Points exactly on the graph are drawn with `0` and estimated points are drawn with `#`

### Building with g++
1. make sure you have g++ installed, then run
2. `g++ new.cpp -o new -std=c++20` (g++ v12)
3. If that doesn't work try `g++ new.cpp -o new -std=c++2a -DSNUMBERS` (for older g++ versions)
4. Run `new.exe`

### Building in VSCode
My .vscode folder is included in the repository.
If you want to use it:
1. Make sure you have g++ and gdb installed.
2. Edit `launch.json` and `tasks.json` and change `command` and `miDebuggerPath` to point to your g++/gdb executables
3. Open the `new.cpp` file in the editor
4. Click `Run -> Start Debugging` or press `F5`

**An overview of the program logic is provided in new.txt**

### Version 1 (v1.cpp)
When run, type 'h' or 'help' for a list of options.

When entering equations, refer to the following modes and syntax structure

**Modes**
- Equation: `0 = (your equation eg. x + 2y)`, uses `x` and `y` variables
- Function: `f(x) = (your equation eg. 3x)`, solves for the `y` variable

**Syntax & operations support:**

Operations are evaluated in the order they appear in this list, then in left-to-right order.

* Groups `( )` eg. `(1/2 + (x/4))`
* Exponents `^` eg. `x^2`
* Multiplication `*` and Division `/` eg. `x * 3` or `x / 3`
  * Multiplication can omit the `*`, so `3x`, `xy`, `(1/2)(xy)` and even `3 4` are valid multiplication
* Addition `+` and subtraction `-` eg. `y - x + 3`
* **[BUG]** Trailing `+` and `-` do not work (eg `-x + 3`). Use `(0 - x)` instead.

### Bugs
- When entering an equation *starting* with addition or subtraction, (eg `+2` or `-x`), a segmentation fault occurs, seemlingly on line `209-210` (the very beginning of `solve->GET`)

  I do not know what is causing this and am not fixing it as I've now started on v2.
